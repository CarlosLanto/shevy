  Vertical rhythm, otherwise known as the "pace" at which objects and words are spaced vertically on a page, is one of life's most unnoticeable pleasantries. It only sticks out when it's bad.

  People shouldn't miss your message because of poorly spaced typography, and you shouldn't have to spend more time than necessary getting vertical rhythm correct. While Shevy can't help you pick out the best fonts, it'll make sure your fonts are perfectly spaced up and down the page.
